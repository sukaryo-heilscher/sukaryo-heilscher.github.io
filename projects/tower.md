I love idle games. Like, way too much. With 7,800 hrs in Clicker Heros, 9,200 hrs in Realm Grinder, and an astounding 15,600 hrs in NGU Idle, I certainly know my way around the genre. For the uninitiated, idle games (also commonly refered to as clicker games) are games where the objective is to make some resource or number grow as much as possible. In the beginning, this usually comes down to manually clicking for each resource until you can start buying some upgrades. Soon enough, the game should start collecting resource by itself, allowing you to let it *idle*. This is the same style as the game a friend, Trevor, and I created called Tyrannic Tower.

In Tyrannic Tower you have 5 resources you must click to start the game: Trees, Gold, Food, Books, and Stone. When you have enough of each resource you can begin to automate the game by buying units to do the clicking for you. Base units are not very good so you need a lot of them to collect the resources. Said units also have upgrades you can give them Strength and Speed. These make the units collect resources faster and more at the same time. There is really no point to the game other than to see how many resources you can collect.

Since my love of idle games I decided to create my own. With the help of my friend we coded the whole thing. Its not the greatest game but it was a fun project to work on.
