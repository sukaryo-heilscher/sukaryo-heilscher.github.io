__"Remember, diamonds are made under pressure." 
-Some filthy liar (or a geologist)__

No, but seriously, just because you can create an analogy to some real world process, doesn't make it true. Not that I don't understand the appeal though. "Diamonds are made under pressure" sounds a lot better than "Spaghetti is made under pressure", regardless of how much the latter reflects my own experience.

## Pressure Cooking Some Spaghetti

It's the end of a semester! A hectic time indeed. Final projects and papers are layered on top of one another, with students scrambling to keep everything from falling apart. Meanwhile, the *Monster Beverage* and *Starbucks* Corporations are rolling in the numerous tithes given to them for their stimulant-based assistance as students grind themselves away long into the night. With all this pressure piled on, it the perfect environment to cook up some spaghetti code.

It didn't matter how well I did on the previous homeworks; I could've read the previously assigned materials thrice over to little consequence; nothing could have prepared me for the final project. With the spectres of deadlines looming over my shoulder, it took everything I had just to get things functional. You know what that means! Spaghetti! Just huge walls of code, constructed primarily using trial and error as almost every single solution I found online managed to spawn some new esoteric error. Modular design, coding standards, compartmenting code? Never heard of it. These paragons of smart coding require forethought, which in turn requires time to plan; a resource I sorely lacked. Speaking of planning...

## Too Many Cooks And No Recipe

I should've been the leader of my group (this was a group project by the way). I don't say this out of spite, like the role was stolen from me. I say this because I shyed away from the role when I was clearly best suited to it. The concept behind the project was primarily my idea. In addition, I always ended up being the one heading our meetings, guiding the group between each topic I wanted to discuss and verifying what everyone was going to work on. However, when it came to the most important aspect of leading a project, creating the plan, I chickened out. 

All I did was just tossed out a basic outline and then let everyone else throw in their own ideas. That in and of itself is fine; it's meant to be collaborative after all. The issue is, I never went back and solidified the final plan with everyone. As a result, everyone was working on the project with a slightly different idea in mind. Needless to say, that caused some contradictions down the line.

## The Final Dish

In the end, I was actually rather proud of what my group had made. Sure it was held together with duct tape and toenails, but it did (mostly) work! Most importantly though, it taught me some valuable lessons. 
1: Learning coding concepts is worthless if you don't use them in practice. With my back against the wall, I succumbed to my primal urges and made spaghetti. In the future, I need to be more disciplined and actually used what I learned.
2: Every group needs a leader. Collaborative effort or not, it's vital to give the group a clear vision of the goal. The leader doesn't need to make every decision or manage each member, but they do need to make sure everyone's on the same page.
