__I HATE METEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Me (2023)__

Bloody hell. Son of a gun. Other PG rated swears. Words cannot express how agonizing an experience it is to work with Meteor, even if I were to allow myself an M rating. Although, it's probably unfair to dump all the blame on Meteor. After all, I still don't even know what it is or where it ends and Bootstrap/React/MongoDB/everything else begins, which is part of the problem. There's way too much stuff going on and none of it is explained!

## Eh... What's Up Doc?

I never realized how much I loved proper documentation until I had to sift through pages upon pages of StackOverflow posts and official pages just to find out how to tell if a Checkbox element was checked or not. Turns out, there's a "checked" property you can use, and yet there's not a single mention of it on the entire [official webpage](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/forms/checks-radios/)! Cool cool, very helpful. Love being told a thousand different ways to arrage it on the screen and not how to actually use the bloody thing!

*But is this actually a Meteor problem?* ...No? I suppose it's a React Boostrap problem. *OK, but what's React Boostrap?* Uhh, it's a combination of React & Bootstrap? React is this thing that lets stuff update on the fly & Bootstrap is a thing that makes it look pretty, I'm pretty sure. *Then what's Meteor?* I DON'T KNOW. 
Looking at Wikipedia,
"It uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publishâ€“subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code."
Wait, isn't that what React's supposed to do? Because, y'know, it Reacts! Or is it that it reacts to the changes that are sent by Meteor? I- I can't- I HATE THIS. It's just a mess of things upon things upon things!

## GET ME OUT OF HERE

It's too much, man. Take me back to Assembly, where things make sense, where I can read out each individual 1 & 0 I place into a register. This matryoshka doll of nebulous frameworks upon libraries upon Shmeagle-knows what else is driving me mad!

I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-2viBhLTqI) recenty about how a graphics programmer got on his career path. At one point he says
