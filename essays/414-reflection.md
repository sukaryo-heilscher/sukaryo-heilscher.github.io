__I HATE METEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Me (2023)__

Bloody hell. Son of a gun. Other PG rated swears. Words cannot express how agonizing an experience it is to work with Meteor, even if I were to allow myself an M rating. Although, it's probably unfair to dump all the blame on Meteor.
