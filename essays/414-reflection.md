__I HATE METEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Me (2023)__

Bloody hell. Son of a gun. Other PG rated swears. Words cannot express how agonizing an experience it is to work with Meteor, even if I were to allow myself an M rating. Although, it's probably unfair to dump all the blame on Meteor. After all, I still don't even know what it is or where it ends and Bootstrap/React/MongoDB/everything else begins, which is part of the problem. There's way too much stuff going on and none of it is explained!

## Eh... What's Up Doc?

I never realized how much I loved proper documentation until I had to sift through pages upon pages of StackOverflow posts and official pages just to find out how to tell if a Checkbox element was checked or not. Turns out, there's a "checked" property you can use, and yet there's not a single mention of it on the entire [official webpage](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/forms/checks-radios/)! Cool cool, very helpful. Love being told a thousand different ways to arrage it on the screen and not how to actually use the bloody thing!

*But is this actually a Meteor problem?* ...No? I suppose it's a React Boostrap problem. *OK, but what's React Boostrap?* Uhh, it's a combination of React & Bootstrap? React is this thing that lets stuff update on the fly & Bootstrap is a thing that makes it look pretty, I'm pretty sure. *Then what's Meteor?* I DON'T KNOW.
