__I HATE METEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!! -Me (2023)__

Bloody hell. Son of a gun. Other PG rated swears. Words cannot express how agonizing an experience it is to work with Meteor, even if I were to allow myself an M rating. Although, it's probably unfair to dump all the blame on Meteor. After all, I still don't even know what it is or where it ends and Bootstrap/React/MongoDB/everything else begins, which is part of the problem. There's way too much stuff going on and none of it is explained!

## Eh... What's Up Doc?

I never realized how much I loved proper documentation until I had to sift through pages upon pages of StackOverflow posts and official pages just to find out how to tell if a Checkbox element was checked or not.
