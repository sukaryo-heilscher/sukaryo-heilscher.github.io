<p><strong>Have you ever had a dream that that you um you had you’d you would you could you’d do you wi you wants you you could do so you you’d do you could you you want you want him to do you so much you could do anything? -Joe Cirkiel (1999)</strong></p>

<p>That’s a bit of a dumb question, isn’t it? Of course, the same could be said for my own question as the answer’s pretty obvious: “Yeah… He was 5.” Although that begs the question: what is a dumb question? And by extension: what’s a smart question?</p>

<p>Luckily these questions have already been answered by Eric Raymond &amp; Rick Moen in <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">this article</a> of theirs. While they go into plenty of details, the idea that stands out most is that smart questions show effort.</p>

<h2 id="effort">Effort?</h2>

<p>Smart questions are asked by people who have and are willing to put in the effort to solve their question. Typically, this is shown when the asker of a question has already taken steps to find an answer on their own before posing the question. For instance, doing a quick Google search or going through the relevant documentation (user manual, FAQ, etc.).</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3297048/403-forbidden-vs-401-unauthorized-http-responses/6937030#6937030">this post</a> from VirtuosiMedia for example. The post asks a simple question about the differences between two HTTP responses but includes a very important phrase: “What I’ve read on each so far…”. They have already done their research but are just having a bit of trouble understanding what they’ve read. Knowing that the asker already knows the basics, JPReddy is able to share a clear explanation that directly addresses the asker’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="help">help</h2>

<p>“help” meanwhile is not a smart question. It’s technically not even a question. “help” is what someone asks when they can’t be bothered to figure things out; when they just want someone else to fix their problem. André Cardoso’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5924741/help-with-substr">post</a> leaves much to be desired. They explain their problem in a single sentence, their attempted solution with another, and ends it off with “help”. David Fells puts it best when he asks, “What is your objective here?”, as it is far from clear. Even mario’s answer to the post had to assume André’s intentions as no effort was made in this question. André had a problem, put it in a post, and nothing more.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-point">So what’s the point?</h2>

<p>Use Google.</p>

<p>I’m only partially joking. Asking a smart question is as simple as trying to find your own solution first, which Google is very helpful for. Once you’ve read up on what you can, then you can know what to ask and what’ll get you the answer you’re looking for. Most importantly though, don’t just say “help”. At the very least, toss a please in there.</p>
