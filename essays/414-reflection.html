<p><strong>“I HATE METEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!” -Me (2023)</strong></p>

<p>Bloody hell. Son of a gun. Other PG rated swears. Words cannot express how agonizing an experience it is to work with Meteor, even if I were to allow myself an M rating. Although, it’s probably unfair to dump all the blame on Meteor. After all, I still don’t even know what it is or where it ends and Bootstrap/React/MongoDB/everything else begins, which is part of the problem. There’s way too much stuff going on and none of it is explained!</p>

<h2 id="eh-whats-up-doc">Eh… What’s Up Doc?</h2>

<p>I never realized how much I loved proper documentation until I had to sift through pages upon pages of StackOverflow posts and official pages just to find out how to tell if a Checkbox element was checked or not. Turns out, there’s a “checked” property you can use, and yet there’s not a single mention of it on the entire <a href="https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/forms/checks-radios/">official webpage</a>! Cool cool, very helpful. Love being told a thousand different ways to arrage it on the screen and not how to actually use the bloody thing!</p>

<p><em>But is this actually a Meteor problem?</em> …No? I suppose it’s a React Boostrap problem. <em>OK, but what’s React Boostrap?</em> Uhh, it’s a combination of React &amp; Bootstrap? React is this thing that lets stuff update on the fly &amp; Bootstrap is a thing that makes it look pretty, I’m pretty sure. <em>Then what’s Meteor?</em> I DON’T KNOW. 
Looking at Wikipedia,
<strong>“It uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publish–subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code.”</strong>
Wait, isn’t that what React’s supposed to do? Because, y’know, it Reacts! Or is it that it reacts to the changes that are sent by Meteor? I- I can’t- I HATE THIS. It’s just a mess of things upon things upon things!</p>

<h2 id="get-me-out-of-here">GET ME OUT OF HERE</h2>

<p>It’s too much, man. Take me back to Assembly, where things make sense, where I can read out each individual 1 &amp; 0 I place into a register. This matryoshka doll of nebulous frameworks upon libraries upon Shmeagle-knows what else is driving me mad!</p>

<p>I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-2viBhLTqI">video</a> recenty about how a graphics programmer got on his career path. At one point he says
<strong>“Unfortunately over time, the Computer Science assignments became less and less interesting. It went from cool creative projects to boring lame web development assignments and I could not stand web development.”</strong>
THAT’S ME. I’ve never felt more seen in my life! So this is why people rally so hard behind representation, it all makes since now! So when I was talking with a professor about what to do for my capstone and he mentioned how he usually proposes webstuff, since it’s “easy” and “what most students seem to want to do”, I shot that down hard. Luckily, he completely agreed with my that webstuff blows and we were able to come up with something much better.</p>

<p>In short, Meteor sucks. Web stuff sucks. Good day.</p>
